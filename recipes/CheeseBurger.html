    <div>
      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, season the ground beef with salt and pepper. Divide the
          beef into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties, about 3/4 inch
          thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes
          on one side, then flip them over.
        </li>
        <li>
          After flipping, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty. Cook
          for another 4-5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the patties
          are cooked to your desired level of doneness (160Â°F for well-done).
        </li>
        <li>
          While the patties are cooking, you can toast the hamburger buns on the
          grill or in a toaster if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the patties are done, remove them from the grill or skillet and
          let them rest for a couple of minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble the burgers by placing a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of
          each bun, followed by the cheeseburger patty, sliced tomato, chopped
          onion, and pickles if using. Add ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise as
          desired. Top with the other half of the bun.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade cheeseburger!</li>
