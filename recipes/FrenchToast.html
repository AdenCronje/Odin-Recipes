    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of bread (preferably slightly stale)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk (whole, skim, or any preferred type)</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, powdered sugar, and fresh fruit for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon (if using), and a pinch of salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the surface.</li>
        <li>Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, allowing it to soak for a few seconds on each side. Ensure the bread is well-coated but not overly saturated.</li>
        <li>Place the soaked bread slices onto the heated skillet. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove the French toast from the skillet and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining slices of bread, adding more butter or oil to the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the French toast warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, powdered sugar, and fresh fruit.</li>
