      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>
          Your favorite toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it
          sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the
          center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough
          forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it
          becomes smooth and elastic. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover
          with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or
          until it doubles in size.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place
          it in the oven to heat up as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to
          your desired thickness. Transfer it to a pizza peel or baking sheet if
          not using a pizza stone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border
          around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese on top,
          followed by your favorite toppings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust
          is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, slice, and enjoy
          your homemade pizza!
